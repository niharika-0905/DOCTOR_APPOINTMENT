DOCTOR APPOINTMENT SUSTEM

This is a console-based Java project that allows patients to book appointments with the appropriate doctor automatically based on their illness or reason for visit.
Patients simply enter their illness, and the system matches them to the correct specialization, shows available time slots with index numbers, and books their appointment easily.

Handles multiple keywords for the same illness (e.g., fever, high temperature, cold → General Physician).

Shows available slots with index numbers for easy selection.

Marks booked slots as unavailable.

Supports multiple doctors and specializations (10+ specializations included).
